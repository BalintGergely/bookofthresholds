Yes...<br>
...I made this because I just could not find an application that helps me keep track of runes in League of Legends. Trust me I googled it.<br>
...I like to experiment with new builds, but I also like to keep track of some of them. 3 pages is not enough.<br>
...I am not using any libraries because I have horrible experiences with anything outside of Java's. (Seriously some of these people think no one reads the documentation and thus don't write any.) This is why Java 11 is required. I even wrote the JSON part.<br>
